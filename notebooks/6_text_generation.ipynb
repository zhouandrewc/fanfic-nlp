      "0: Sokka's lips parted. \"I can't believe I'm getting married to someone who is going after my own children,\" he said, and he sounded so sad. Zuko brought a hand up to his mouth as Zuko sighed heavily before turning to look at him again. \"You're kidding me!  \"What does that mean?  \"I can't imagine having to do it alone for the rest of your life,\" Sokka said honestly. Zuko didn't want to admit that. They'd already been through this together and had both gotten along well enough that he thought they were going to be good people eventually in their lives. \"No, I think you don't have to deal with this right now,\" Toph said. She was wearing her new boyfriend's outfit all day. It was probably just her imagination that had been running through her head when they got there, but she could see the way his expression softened when he turned away from them, back towards the tree trunk. \"Do you\n",
      "1: Sokka's mouth twitches into a smile, and Sokka shakes his head at the sight. \"Not that I'm surprised you did,\" he says, after a moment. \"I was just curious about what you were doing in Ba Sing Se. I mean, you are an interesting person. But it is also something we have been spending some time together because of, well, our mother's death -\" His eyes narrow once more, in concentration to make out a little figure in the darkness around them, then open with a chuckle. \"I am pretty sure it doesn't matter,\" he explains quickly as he looks away from the dark figure, and then back up again. \"Did you ever think about what that would be like?  \"Only for the most part. We have had a lot going on between us. And now, you know, we're in this together. I hope that means something-\" \"You said that already! Sokka laughs a bit, and then rolls his eyes\n",
      "2: Sokka, Sokka? \"Hey, I just wanted to say that my mom is dead.  He says without thinking of it any longer. \"And you've said so many things about me since then I don't think she's going anywhere,\" Zuko says honestly. Sokka looks away from him again for a second and nods sagely in return before walking away. \"You know the rest, my brother! Sokka points out with an enthusiastic smile as they ride off the car with Toph and Katara followed by a couple of other people, and she seems extremely excited for them all. Katara laughs once and she turns back towards the street, where they were once more and watches the car pull away from the curb and into the quiet parking lot. She walks away from the car and sits down on the dirt bench beside it. She looks at the phone in her hand, and she sighs against it. She has no idea if Katara knows or not what they're texting over. \"I\n"
