# "Yip Yip!": A Fanfiction Recommendation App(a)
## by Andrew Zhou

An application that recommends <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> fanfiction from my assembled corpus, given input fanfiction text from a user.

### Tools Used

* [WordCloud](https://amueller.github.io/word_cloud/)
* Streamlit
* Gensim

### Data

Our data are from the website [Archive of Our Own](http://archiveofourown.org), or AO3.

## Notes

The app is currently not deployed (17 November 2020) but I'm working on doing so; I want to ensure that rehosting short snippets of text from AO3 users' fanfictions is permissible.
